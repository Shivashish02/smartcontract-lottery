# SmartContract Lottery

The contract is deployed at this address 
```
0x8cEe22715474b36cF3daaAb332e86C64bf1E8468 
```
on the rinkeby ethereum testnet.

Any user can interact with the contract as the contract has been verified. Also when deploying on the testnet all the other contracts that are needed are already deployed on the network and as such we do not need to deploy them ourselves.
But in case, we are deploying the contract on our own blockchain netwrok we need to deploy even the supplementary contract.

```
For interacting with the contract deployed on the mainnet, the user needs to connect his metamask wallet with the contract
